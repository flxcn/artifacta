Research question: is it possible to build a comprehensive map of the crusades and its afterlife

artifacts 

coins

art made following the crusades

temporal 11th cent

is this relevant? 


Major steps

1. Filter

2. AI checking: how relevant is this to the Crusades (afterlife or possibly later)

3. Now we have a base set of items. How to make sense of them? Categorizing thematically

4. Visualize. How can we see the connections across the items in the collections
