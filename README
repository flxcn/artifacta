Dear Felix,


Thank you for sharing your great formats and suggestions! I am excited to be working with you! Following our recent conversation, I wanted to share some thoughts and suggestions regarding your final project: possibly a digital space to tell the story of the Crusades through 100 objects.

 

In 2022/23, we created a skeletal platform entitled “At Cross Purposes: The Crusades in 100 Objects.” At that time, we only developed the opening page and created sections/titles/tabs for the virtual galleries where various works of art would be displayed. The purpose of this platform was multifaceted:

- To shed light on the Crusades and their reception and to retell some of these compelling stories through the lens of the material culture produced in the context of the Crusades or in response to them (especially in the early modern period).

- To showcase the world-class collections at Harvard that relate to the Crusades and their legacy, which are often disjointed and rarely displayed in the galleries of the Harvard Art Museum. - To emphasize the relevance of the Crusades in modern political, economic, and artistic discourse.

- To shift the focus back on the works of art themselves.

The old platform can be accessed here: https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/crusadesin100objects. Since WordPress is going away, would you like to create a new site along the lines of “At Cross Purposes: The Crusades in 100 Objects?” Considering that Crusades-related works of art in the Harvard Collections are better understood within themes rather than by provenance or periods, how do you envision the new platform? What themes or sections would you like to include? Currently, Harvard provides a digital platform as a continuation of WordPress: https://www.huit.harvard.edu/campuspress. As part of the HAA, we can request a dedicated site for you to build.

 

Regarding content, following our last conversation on how to connect the dots, you may to consider what to include in a "Crusades in Material Culture" digital space or the story of the Crusades told through 100 objects. Here are a few initial recommendations based on our inquiries this semester:

- The Road to Jerusalem (pilgrimage, the Crusaders at the Gates of Jerusalem, three worthy kings, etc)

- Jerusalem, our Inheritance (Godfrey de Bouillon, photography of holy sites, etc)

- New Jerusalems (Sainte Chapelle, Paris; Westminster, London; San Marco, Venice)

- Christ, Cross, and Saint Helena (the Crusaders viewed Saint Helena as a proto-Crusader; her legacy and increased visibility in late medieval and early modern Europe)

- Money, Money, Money (shared cultures, imitations, legitimacy, and the rise of global trade)

- The Reception of the Crusades in Early Modern Europe (from T. Tasso's *Jerusalem Delivered* to 19th-century Pre-Raphaelites and photography of the Holy Land)

 

In terms of curating different themes and sections, aside from the content you can generate, please see attached the link to additional datasets that related to some of these themes created by Shani, Hayley, and Micah and available for your curation. We can also tap on some of the entries created this semester by members of our Seminar. I will be happy to connect you to Shani, Hayley, and Micah.

 

To add more layers to your digital resource, consider following Neil McGregor's example of effective communication by engaging your audience in various ways. Embedding 5-8 short clips or podcasts (2-3 minutes long) that focus on particular objects might be a great idea. The Bok Center would be delighted to host you and provide equipment, including a booth where you can record yourself.

 

 

 

Looking forward to your thoughts!
